## LittleSis Account User Agreement

LittleSis.org welcomes members of the public to join our community and contribute to our database. However, we reserve the right to restrict accounts that contribute information not suitable for our database. The LittleSis staff is responsible for making editorial decisions about database contributions.

**All LittleSis analysts are required to accept to the following agreement:**

I understand that LittleSis's mission is to track people and groups with inordinate wealth, influence on public policy, and access to government officials. As a LittleSis analyst it is my responsibility to ensure that information I contribute is relevant to the site's mission, accurate, and documented by publicly available original sources on the internet. The LittleSis staff can revoke my editing privileges or disable my account if they believe I am not following these guidelines in good faith. LittleSis staff can revoke my editing privileges and remove any edits, maps, or lists that I create that are in violation of these terms of use including:

- Contributions that promote violence or hate against a marginalized group or use hate speech
- Contributions that fall outside the purview of our mission to track people and groups with inordinate wealth and influence
- Contributions that spam the database

I understand that if I am in violation of any of these terms of use my account will be restricted from editing while LittleSis staff investigate and delete any data that is inappropriate for the site. If the violation occurred by accident I can appeal to have my editing restrictions lifted, however this is at the discretion of LittleSis staff. Repeated violations will result in a suspension of my LittleSis account.

## No formal peer review

LittleSis is an online open-content collaborative project that accepts contributions from the general public. Although the LittleSis team is constantly keeping an eye on the data pulled in from our bots as well as the work of our analysts, LittleSis cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. Analysts themselves are encouraged to keep an eye out for mistakes made by other users. That's how a wiki works. However, LittleSis is not uniformly peer reviewed; while users may correct errors or engage in casual review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever.

None of the authors, contributors, sponsors, administrators, sysops, or anyone else connected with LittleSis in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate or libelous information or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.
